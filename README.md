Blockquotes:
>Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
>This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

>This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Inline HTML:
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometions.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

Horizontal Rule:
Here is a line for us to start with.


This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *seperate paragraph*.


This line is also a seperate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a seperate line in the *same paragraph*.
